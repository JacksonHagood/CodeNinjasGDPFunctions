Code Ninjas | The Woodlands | Jackson Hagood

Encyclopedia for all of the pre-written
functions within the Game Development
Platform (Currently up to Orange Belt).

Each documented function contains a
description, example(s), and further
reference.

Functions have been grouped by category,
and each category is programmed as its
own page. The pages have been setup to 
link between themselves.

Green Belt content will be added as the
tool gets used more.

This is meant to be used as an offline file 
on student's computers. This will NOT be 
used as a live webpage accessible on the 
internet. The tool has been made in HTML
for the sole purpose of making it easier 
for ninjas to use.

This is also a tool for Senseis to use
when helping ninjas. Each location is
welcome to make their own changes to the
content.

Images were made using Blender
